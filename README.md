# shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial

For this assignment we will be using the Shiny tutorial that was developed as a three part series on developing apps. 

This repository contains the slides and exercises for the video tutorial at https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial. 

For this assignment, you will make changes in each of the early files of each part so that they match the examples in the video. There are two files you should be editing and as you work on section you can develop the file to match the examples:

 * Edit `part-1-code/01-template.R` to match `part-1-code/02-hist-app.R`
 * Edit `part-2-code/01-two-inputs.R` to match `part-2-code/03-reactive.R`
 * Continue to edit `part-2-code/01-two-inputs.R` to match `part-2-code/07-eventReactive.R`

The assignment should have two files changed with at least three commits. You may stop watching the video after 1 hour and 30 minutes.
